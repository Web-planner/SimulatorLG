<center><h1> Introduction to Logic Gates</h1></center>
<h3><br>Logic gates are the heart of digital electronics. A gate is an electronic device which is used to compute a function on a two valued signal. Logic gates are the basic building block of digital circuits.<br>
<br>Basically, all logic gates have one output and two inputs. Some logic gates like NOT gate or Inverter has only one input and one output. The inputs of the logic gates are designed to receive only binary data (only low 0 or high 1) by receiving the voltage input.<br>
<br>The low logic level represents Zero volts and high logic level represents 3 or 5 volts positive supply voltage.<br>
<br>We can connect any number of logic gates to design a required digital circuit. Practically, we implement the large number of logic gates in ICs, by which we can save the physical space occupied by the large number of logic gates. We can also perform complicated operations at high speeds by using integrated circuits (IC).
By combining logic gates, we can design many specific circuits like flip flops, latches, multiplexers, shift registers etc.
